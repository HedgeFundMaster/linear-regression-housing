This simple linear regression model explores the relationship between median income (MedInc) and median house value in California districts. Using only median income as a predictor, the model produces a coefficient of 0.4193, suggesting that for every $10,000 increase in median income, predicted house value increases by approximately $41,934. The intercept of 0.4446 implies a baseline house value of ~$44,460 when income approaches zero â€” more of a mathematical anchor than an economic reality.

With a mean squared error of 0.709, the model's average prediction error translates to roughly $84,100, signaling that income alone doesn't fully capture housing price variation. The RÂ² score of 0.459 means the model explains about 46% of the variance in home values â€” solid for a single-variable regression, but also a clear indicator that additional features are needed to capture the full complexity of the housing market (e.g., location, housing stock, or geography).
